Link to Website: https://josh484.github.io/Horiseon-SEO/
## Description 
The website must be able to meet accessibility standards so that it is optimised for search engines. I was given a website with non of these specifications therefore I changed the HTML code in order to create Semantic Elements for the user.
At the end of this project I learnt how to create a well structured website that has many labeled sections rather than a random assortment of divs with no explanation. 
## Installation
In order to install the project simply click the green code button and download the file as a zip. 
Once downloaded simply right click on the file and unzip the folder.
## Usage 
When the file is downloaded you can open the index.html on your web browser and from there right click on the page and inspect element you should be able to see the semantic elements of the website as shown on the image below:
